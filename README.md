# Enigma
## What Is This Program About?
This Java program is an emulation of a classical Enigma machine that consists of a right rotor, a left rotor and a reflector.

## What Is Enigma Machine?
Enigma machine is a cipher device used to protect communication. For more details about the ingenious device, check [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine).

## How Does Enigma Machine Work?
Plaintext is encoded to ciphertext through the following process: 

plaintext -> right rotor -> left rotor -> reflector -> left rotor -> right rotor -> ciphertext

## What Does The Program contain?
The program has 3 Java classes, each with name representing the conponent of Engima machine it emulates, for constructing Enigma and 1 Java class for running the program.
